# Order Lifecycle Foundation — Implementation Tracker

Companion to [`docs/order_lifecycle_state_machine.md`](order_lifecycle_state_machine.md) (the discovery doc, merged in PR #59).
Tracks implementation progress for the foundation PR — schema + `apply_order_event` + reconciliation paths + compensating-patch absorption.

## Phase 1 — Foundation PR scope

The foundation PR implements the discovery doc's §6 (schema + atomic event API + rollups), §10 (compensating-patch absorption), and §12 (tests + migration prerequisites). Strategy-side strict, write-side substrate only. Consumer migration and PR #58 rebuild are explicitly deferred.

| Phase | Scope | Branch | PR | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Schema + `apply_order_event` + reconciliation paths + cache removal + 26-test matrix | `feat/order-lifecycle-foundation-impl` | — | 🔄 In progress |

## §12.1 Regression test matrix progress

All 26 tests from the discovery doc must land in the implementation PR. Each test row identifies the regression it guards against.

| # | Test (abbreviated) | Doc anchor | Commit | Status |

## Migration prerequisites (§12.2)

Per discovery doc §12.2, the implementation PR must include a duplicate-row preflight that runs BEFORE `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX` on every startup. If duplicates exist:

1. Log `ERROR`-level message listing affected `order_id` / `owner_key` values
2. Surface through alert backend
3. `_ensure_db()` raises; bot exits non-zero
4. Operator runs `scripts/migrate_dedupe_trades.py` offline (detection / review / apply modes)
5. Next `recycle_bot.sh` applies the unique indexes cleanly

Implementation PR includes:
- [ ] Pre-flight detection queries (commit 2)
- [ ] `_ensure_db()` raises on duplicates (commit 2)
- [ ] `scripts/migrate_dedupe_trades.py` with three modes (commit 2)
- [ ] PLAN.md operator-runbook entry for the script (commit 13)

---

## Documentation updates (§12 / §11)

The foundation PR must update (per discovery doc §12):

- [ ] `PLAN.md` — Live readiness gate row for slippage / operator controls; foundation PR in flight or merged; PR #58 awaiting rebuild
- [ ] `docs/operator_controls_proposal.md` §17 amended for write-side / read-side substrate split + per-order table substrate Phase C writes into
- [ ] `docs/slippage_unification_tracker.md` — Phase 2 scope references foundation-provided pre-fill provenance
- [ ] PR #58 description — (already done — converted to draft with blocked/cherry-pickable list)

---

## Smoke check protocol (post-merge)

Foundation PR merges to main. Bot recycles on main with the new code. Smoke check verifies before declaring foundation green:

- [ ] Bot recycles cleanly (migration runs idempotently)
- [ ] Pre-flight duplicate check passes on production DB (or operator runs dedupe script first)
- [ ] First post-merge entry creates a `position_lifecycle_orders` row at `pending` → `working` / `filled`
- [ ] First post-merge exit creates a `role='exit'` row; position transitions to `closed` after exit terminates
- [ ] First post-merge stop fill advances the existing `protective_stop` row to `filled`
- [ ] `_suspect_orders` cache is empty (or absent) throughout
- [ ] Parity check: per-order rollups (`current_qty`, `avg_entry_price`, `net_realized_pnl`) match the legacy values on `position_lifecycle`

Once smoke passes, PR #58 rebuild can start.

---

## Rollback plan

`git revert <foundation-merge-sha> && ./recycle_bot.sh`. The new tables remain in `data/trades.db` but no code writes them post-revert. Pre-existing rows are untouched. The `_suspect_orders` / `_suspect_exit_orders` caches are restored by the revert.

Idempotent — safe to apply and revert any number of times during smoke validation.

## Open decisions

| Question | Decision | Date |
|---|---|---|
| Branch name | `feat/order-lifecycle-foundation-impl` (discovery doc was on `feat/order-lifecycle-foundation`) | 2026-06-12 |
| `option_trailing_stops` migration scope | Soft (FK reference column added; existing columns kept as denormalized mirrors during migration) | discovery doc §10.4 |
| `apply_order_event` API location | New module `engine/lifecycle_orders.py` to keep separation from `engine/lifecycle.py` (position-level store) | (TBD during commit 3) |
| Suspect-cache removal sequence | After verification of cycle / stream / startup paths, NOT day-one of merge | discovery doc §10.9 step 3 |
