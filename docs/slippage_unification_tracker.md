## Phase 1 — As-built summary

Phase 1 is complete on `feature/slippage-unification-phase1` with five
review-response commits added after the first ChatGPT/Gemini pass. Total
~1700 LOC including tests, 2093/2093 tests passing.

Review-response commits (review-1):

| Defect | Severity | Fix commit |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Exit path mis-tagged as arrival_midpoint | High | `5b4e3ff` |
| 2. SuspectOrder loses fallback provenance | Medium | `4c727ae` |
| 3. Migration failure poisoned cached connection | Medium | `a059406` |
| 4. Non-finite stop_price accepted | Medium | `78d4567` |
| 5. Undocumented parity exceptions | Low | (this commit) |

Documented Phase 1 divergence (intentional, deferred to Phase 2 consumer
migration):

- **Market entry without `modeled_price`** — legacy
  `realized_slippage_bps` still falls back to
  `decision.entry_reference_price`; new `slippage_signed_bps` is NULL.
  Aligning would change consumer-visible numbers today; defer to
  Phase 2. Pinned by
  `test_market_entry_without_benchmark_legacy_still_uses_decision_price`.

What landed:

- **6 nullable taxonomy columns** on `trades` (`slippage_benchmark_price`,
  `slippage_benchmark_kind`, `slippage_benchmark_timestamp`,
  `slippage_measurement_quality`, `slippage_signed_bps`,
  `slippage_adverse_bps`) plus `stop_trigger_price`. Idempotent ALTER on
  every bootstrap; pre-existing rows stay NULL.
- **`Literal[...]` enum aliases** (`SlippageBenchmarkKind`,
  `SlippageMeasurementQuality`) in `reporting.logger` so every writer
  call site is type-checked.
- **Stateless stop benchmarking** — `log_stop_fill` now accepts
  `stop_price: float | None` directly from the broker order at fill
  time. WebSocket path reads `update.order.stop_price`; recovery path
  reads `ClosedOrderInfo.stop_price`. No mutable open-position state.
  This is the load-bearing fix from the design.
- **All 13 codepaths** tag rows with explicit benchmark kind + quality.
  Default inference in `build_record` / `build_close_record` preserves
  prior behavior for any future caller that omits the parameters.
- **Dual-write preserved** — every populated row writes both the new
  taxonomy columns and the legacy `realized_slippage_bps` /
  `modeled_slippage_bps`. Where both are non-NULL they MUST agree, and
  five focused parity tests guard against drift.
- **Honest unavailable rows** — `log_external_close` no longer
  fabricates `0.0` for rows that never had real measurements (a
  deliberate change from the prior placeholder; Phase 2 consumers
  must handle NULL).

What did NOT land in Phase 1 (deferred as planned):

- Consumer migration (health, risk, calibration, dashboard) — Phase 2.
- Dashboard denominator dilution fix — Phase 2.
- Stop legacy dual-writes — Phase 2 (folded in from prior Phase 4).
- Historical row cleanup migration — Phase 3.

## Phase 1 — Codepath coverage status

Per the design doc's matrix. Each row must end Phase 1 with the correct
`slippage_benchmark_kind` + `slippage_measurement_quality` pair pinned by a
test.

| # | Codepath | Site | Expected kind | Expected quality | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Single-leg market entry | `engine/trader.py:1591` `_log_entry` | `arrival_midpoint` / `fallback_latest_close` | `primary` / `fallback` | ✅ |
| 2 | Single-leg limit entry | `reporting/logger.py:425` `build_record` | `limit_price` | `unavailable` | ✅ |
| 3 | Discretionary market exit | `reporting/logger.py:504` `build_close_record` via `_close_single_leg_position` | equity `fallback_latest_close` / option `unavailable` (Defect 1 fix) | `fallback` / `unavailable` | ✅ |
| 4 | WebSocket stop fill | `engine/trader.py:3530` | `active_stop_price` | `primary` | ✅ |
| 5 | Broker-history recovered stop fill | `engine/trader.py:2974` | `active_stop_price` | `recovered` | ✅ |
| 6 | Standalone repair-stop fill | (falls through 4/5) | `active_stop_price` | `primary`/`recovered` | ✅ (via 4/5) |
| 7 | Fractional residual cleanup exit | `engine/trader.py:2509` `_log_close` via `_close_fractional_residual_position` | `unavailable` | `unavailable` | ✅ |

## Phase 1 — Schema additions

New columns on `trades` (all `NULL`-default, no indexes):

```sql
ALTER TABLE trades ADD COLUMN slippage_benchmark_price REAL;
ALTER TABLE trades ADD COLUMN slippage_benchmark_kind TEXT;
ALTER TABLE trades ADD COLUMN slippage_benchmark_timestamp TEXT;
ALTER TABLE trades ADD COLUMN slippage_measurement_quality TEXT;
ALTER TABLE trades ADD COLUMN slippage_signed_bps REAL;
ALTER TABLE trades ADD COLUMN slippage_adverse_bps REAL;
ALTER TABLE trades ADD COLUMN stop_trigger_price REAL;
```

Enum values (enforced via `Literal[...]` in `TradeRecord`):

- `slippage_benchmark_kind`: `arrival_midpoint`, `decision_price`, `fallback_latest_close`, `active_stop_price`, `combo_limit`, `limit_price`, `unavailable`
- `slippage_measurement_quality`: `primary`, `fallback`, `recovered`, `unavailable`

## Smoke check plan (between Phase 1 and Phase 2)

Goal: confirm writers fire correctly across codepaths that actually trigger
in ~2 paper days on main after PR #43 merged. Not exhaustive — coverage
gaps get caught in Phase 2 review.

**Operator action required after merge:** `./recycle_bot.sh` to pick up the
new code. Migration runs idempotently on the first `_ensure_db()` call.

Checklist:

- [ ] Bot recycles cleanly on main (no schema migration errors in logs)
- [ ] Spot-check 5+ entry rows: `slippage_benchmark_kind IS NOT NULL`
- [ ] Spot-check any exit rows: parity holds where expected
- [ ] If any stop fires: confirm `stop_trigger_price IS NOT NULL`, `kind='active_stop_price'`
- [ ] If any spread fills: confirm long-leg row has NULL slippage, not `0.0`
- [ ] Dashboard still renders without errors (consumers still read legacy columns)
- [ ] Health report still runs (`scripts/strategy_health_review.py`)
- [ ] Risk kill switch does not trip on bogus values

Spot-check queries (run against `data/trades.db`):

```sql
-- 1. Writers populate new columns across all kinds we expect to see
SELECT slippage_benchmark_kind, slippage_measurement_quality, COUNT(*)
FROM trades
WHERE timestamp >= '<merge-date>'
GROUP BY slippage_benchmark_kind, slippage_measurement_quality;

-- 2. Parity guard — zero rows expected
SELECT COUNT(*) AS drifted
FROM trades
WHERE slippage_signed_bps IS NOT NULL
  AND realized_slippage_bps IS NOT NULL
  AND ABS(realized_slippage_bps - slippage_signed_bps) > 0.01;

-- 3. External close rows write NULL on both column families
SELECT realized_slippage_bps, slippage_signed_bps, COUNT(*)
FROM trades
WHERE reason LIKE '%external%' AND timestamp >= '<merge-date>'
GROUP BY realized_slippage_bps, slippage_signed_bps;
```

Rollback plan if smoke surfaces a regression: `git revert bf16b5a && ./recycle_bot.sh`.
New writes return to legacy-only behavior; pre-existing rows untouched;
smoke-period rows keep their new columns populated but no consumer reads them.

## Phase 2 + 4 — As-built summary

Phase 2 + 4 landed on `feature/slippage-unification-phase2` as 9
commits (commit 0 tracker kickoff + 8 logical commits). Full suite
2712 passed.

What landed:

- **Health assessor** (`strategies/health/assessor.py:_slippage_p95_bps`)
  reads `slippage_adverse_bps` directly; quality whitelist
  `slippage_measurement_quality IN ('primary','fallback')` replaces
  the legacy `reason NOT LIKE` defensive filter. Fails closed for
  any future enum.
- **Calibration script** (`scripts/calibrate_health_thresholds.py`)
  mirrors the assessor query — same column, same whitelist.
- **RiskManager** (`risk/manager.py`) `record_fill_slippage`
  parameter renamed `realized_bps` → `adverse_bps`. The engine
  was already clamping to adverse before calling; the rename
  aligns naming with the persisted column and the docstring +
  log lines now refer to "adverse" rather than the ambiguous
  "realized" (no behavior change).
- **Dashboard Recent Trades** surfaces `slippage_benchmark_kind`
  + `slippage_measurement_quality` columns alongside the bps
  value so the operator can audit every slippage number's
  measurement context (`arrival_midpoint`/`active_stop_price`/
  `limit_price`/`unavailable`; `primary`/`fallback`/`recovered`).
- **Dashboard `compute_strategy_stats`** migrated to
  `slippage_adverse_bps`. **Denominator dilution fix**: numerator
  and denominator gated on the same `.notna()` mask for both
  single-leg and MLEG branches; the pre-Phase-2 MLEG long-leg
  `avg_fill_price > 0` workaround is removed (the unified
  column's NULL value is the structural-zero signal). Column
  header renamed `Avg Slippage Bps` → `Avg Adverse Slippage Bps`.
- **`reporting/pnl.py`** weekly summary, daily slippage stats,
  `slippage_report`, and per-strategy attribution all read
  `slippage_adverse_bps` via the `_adverse_bps()` helper that
  returns `Optional[float]`. Rows with NULL slippage are skipped,
  not defaulted to 0 — operator-facing means are no longer
  silently diluted toward zero by paths without a benchmark.
  Labels updated to "Mean adverse slippage" / "Max adverse
  slippage".
- **Legacy dual-write removed** (Phase 4 fold-in) across
  `build_record`, `build_close_record`, `log_stop_fill`, and
  `log_spread_fill`. New rows write NULL on
  `modeled_slippage_bps` / `realized_slippage_bps`; the new
  taxonomy columns are the sole source of truth. The Phase 1
  market-entry-without-benchmark divergence is reconciled — no
  more silent `decision.entry_reference_price` fallback.
- **Test sweep**: `TestSlippageDualWriteParity` (5 tests)
  replaced with `TestNoLegacyWritesOnNewRows` (5 tests + the
  MLEG long-leg structural-zero regression guard). The
  Phase 1 pinned test
  `test_market_entry_without_benchmark_legacy_still_uses_decision_price`
  is replaced with the reconciled-divergence pin.

What did NOT land in Phase 2 (deferred as planned):

- Historical row cleanup migration — Phase 3.

## Phase 2 + 4 — Consumer migration scope

Branch: `feature/slippage-unification-phase2`

- [x] `strategies/health/assessor.py` reads `slippage_adverse_bps` (and filters by `measurement_quality`)
- [x] `risk/manager.py` kill switch reads `slippage_adverse_bps` (param rename — engine clamps to adverse before calling)
- [x] `scripts/calibrate_health_thresholds.py` reads `slippage_adverse_bps`
- [x] `dashboard.py` Recent Trades displays `slippage_benchmark_kind` + `measurement_quality` alongside slippage bps
- [x] `dashboard.py:710` denominator dilution fix — `.notna()` mask on numerator + denominator
- [x] `reporting/pnl.py` weekly/daily/slippage reports read `slippage_adverse_bps`; skip NULL rows
- [x] Stop dual-writing `realized_slippage_bps` / `modeled_slippage_bps` on new rows (Phase 4 fold-in)
- [x] Update tests that read legacy columns
- [x] **Reconcile Phase 1 divergence**: market-entry path without `modeled_price` — both legacy AND new columns now NULL (dual-write removed).

## Phase 3 — Historical cleanup scope

Branch: `feature/slippage-unification-phase3`

Two deterministic predicates (idempotent migration script with dry-run mode):

```sql
-- Phantom recovery rows (pre-32e21c2)
UPDATE trades
SET realized_slippage_bps = NULL, modeled_slippage_bps = NULL
WHERE reason LIKE '%recovered entry context%'
  AND realized_slippage_bps IS NOT NULL
  AND timestamp < '2026-06-02T18:20:37+00:00';

-- Pre-LIMIT-carve-out limit rows (pre-8316e64)
UPDATE trades
SET realized_slippage_bps = NULL, modeled_slippage_bps = NULL
WHERE order_type = 'limit'
  AND realized_slippage_bps IS NOT NULL
  AND timestamp < '2026-06-02T23:31:45+00:00';
```

- [ ] Script runs in `--dry-run` mode, prints affected row count per predicate
- [ ] Backup `trades.db` before destructive run
- [ ] Verify post-run row counts match dry-run prediction
- [ ] Health / dashboard re-render confirms cleaner averages
